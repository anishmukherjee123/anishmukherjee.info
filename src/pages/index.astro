          I'm Anish, a DevOps engineer working at <a
            href="https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/solutions/uptodate"
            >Wolters Kluwer</a

          I love making music, picking up new hobbies, and nerdy cloud
          automation. This is a hub for sharing my thoughts, experiments, and
          discoveries - both professional and personal.

          This website is a WIP, so please bear with me as I continue to add
          more content.
