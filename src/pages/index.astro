            I'm Anish, a DevOps engineer working at <a
              href="https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/solutions/uptodate"
              >Wolters Kluwer</a

            I love making music, picking up new hobbies, and nerdy cloud
            automation. This is a hub for sharing my thoughts, experiments, and
            discoveries - both professional and personal.
          </p>

            This website is a WIP, so please bear with me as I continue to add
            more content.
